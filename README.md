## Introduction : 

In this project, we emphasize a hands-on approach where we will search for datasets containing both image and signature malware samples. and we will follow a structured machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, training multiple models, and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. By integrating MLOps practices throughout the process, for gaining valuable experience in managing the lifecycle of machine learning models in cybersecurity applications.

<strong>Angular :</strong> Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application framework. It is used for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) where content is loaded dynamically without the need for full-page reloads.

<strong>MLOps:</strong>  MLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, is the practice of integrating machine learning (ML) models into the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It aims to streamline the deployment, monitoring, and management of ML models in production environments." alt="Angular" width="250" align="left" style="margin-right: 15px;" />


<strong>GitHub (CI/CD): </strong>GitHub is a platform for hosting and sharing code repositories. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is a set of practices used to automate the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository (CI) and deploying code to production environments (CD) after passing automated tests.


<strong>Scikit-learn (sklearn): </strong> Scikit-learn is an open-source machine learning library for Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. Scikit-learn features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms, including support for model evaluation and data preprocessing. It is designed to interoperate with other Python libraries such as NumPy and pandas.
## Models training :

In our project, we're using machine learning to improve malware detection. We train our models in two ways: one, by looking at the unique signatures or patterns of known malware, and two, by analyzing the visual characteristics of malware samples converted into images. This dual approach helps us build a more effective system for identifying and classifying malware, even if it's never been seen before.

### images data :

In this section, we describe the process of training machine learning models using the dataset containing images of malware and non-malware samples. We focus on two popular classifiers, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to classify the images and evaluate their performance.

#### using SVM :
<strong>SVM</strong>, or <strong>Support Vector Machine</strong>, is a supervised machine learning algorithm commonly employed for tasks involving classification and regression. It operates by identifying the hyperplane that most effectively segregates distinct classes within the feature space. We selected SVM for this project due to its effectiveness in determining whether an image represents malware or benign content.
At first, We collected a dataset consisting of images of malware and non-malware images. The images were preprocessed to extract relevant features using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method. The HOG method was chosen for its ability to capture important features from images. It converts images into histograms of gradient orientations, which are then used as input features for training the SVM model.
then The dataset was split into training and validation sets. To address class imbalance, we used the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic samples of the minority class. The features were standardized using StandardScaler before training the SVM model.
After all, We evaluated the performance of the SVM model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.And We utilized MLflow to track the training process and log important metrics, parameters, and artifacts.
At the end The best-performing SVM model was saved using joblib for potential deployment in a production environment. Considerations for model deployment, such as scalability and reliability, were also discussed.

#### using random Forest :

## conclusion :
In conclusion, this project successfully implemented a malware detection system using machine learning techniques. By extracting features from images and training a Random Forest classifier, we were able to achieve effective detection of malware. The use of SMOTE to address class imbalance and MLflow for experiment tracking and model management further enhanced the project's robustness and scalability. Overall, this project highlights the potential of machine learning in cybersecurity and provides a solid foundation for future research and development in this field.
