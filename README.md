# Introduction : 

In this project, we emphasize a hands-on approach where we will search for datasets containing both image and signature malware samples. and we will follow a structured machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, training multiple models, and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. By integrating MLOps practices throughout the process, for gaining valuable experience in managing the lifecycle of machine learning models in cybersecurity applications.

# Models training :
## Signature based model
To train this model, we looked for a detailed dataset and we found one that containes PE file headers of diffrent legitimate and malwared files.
### Model Training
#### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Data Loading and Initial Preparation
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file.
   - Rename columns for better readability.
   - Check the initial few rows, shape, and statistical description of the dataset.
   - Check for null values and remove duplicates.
2. Data Exploration and Visualization
   - Analyze the class distribution of the target variable (legitimate).
   - Visualize the class distribution using a bar plot.
3. Feature Selection
   - Drop unnecessary columns (Name, md5, legitimate).
   - Fit an ExtraTreesClassifier to identify important features.
   - Select important features based on the feature importances from the classifier.
4. Data Scaling
   - Apply standard scaling to the selected features to normalize the data.
5. Handling Class Imbalance
   - Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the training data.
6. Model Training and Evaluation
   - Initialize three different models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - Perform cross-validation to evaluate the performance of each model.
   - Select the best model based on cross-validation scores.
   - Train the selected models on the training data and evaluate them on the test data.
   - Select the best performing model based on test data accuracy.
7. Saving the Model
   - Save the best model and the selected features using joblib and pickle.
  ### Extracting PE Headers
  To extract PE (Portable Executable) headers, we use the 'pefile' library, which allows us to parse PE files and extract relevant features.
  #### Functions for Extraction
  1. Entropy Calculation
     Calculates the entropy of data, which measures the randomness. Higher entropy indicates more randomness.
2. Resource Extraction
   Extracts resources from the PE file and calculates their entropy and size.
3. Version Info Extraction
   Extracts version information from the PE file.
4. Main Extraction Function
  Combines all the above functions to extract comprehensive information from the PE file.
  - the targeted pe headers:
    1. feature DllCharacteristics
    2. feature Characteristics
    3. feature Machine
    4. feature SectionsMaxEntropy
    5. feature Subsystem
    6. feature VersionInformationSize
    7. feature ImageBase
    8. feature MajorSubsystemVersion
    9. feature SizeOfOptionalHeader
    10. feature ResourcesMinEntropy
    11. feature ResourcesMaxEntropy
    12. feature SizeOfStackReserve

  ## Image based model

In our project, we're using machine learning to improve malware detection. We train our models in two ways: one, by looking at the unique signatures or patterns of known malware, and two, by analyzing the visual characteristics of malware samples converted into images. This dual approach helps us build a more effective system for identifying and classifying malware, even if it's never been seen before.

</br> 

### images data :


In this section, we describe the process of training machine learning models using the dataset containing images of malware and non-malware samples. We focus on two popular classifiers, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to classify the images and evaluate their performance.

</br>

#### using SVM :

<strong>SVM</strong>, or <strong>Support Vector Machine</strong>, is a supervised machine learning algorithm commonly employed for tasks involving classification and regression. It operates by identifying the hyperplane that most effectively segregates distinct classes within the feature space. We selected SVM for this project due to its 
effectiveness in determining whether an image represents malware or benign content.


At first, We collected a dataset consisting of images of malware and non-malware images. The images were preprocessed to extract relevant features using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method. The HOG method was chosen for its ability to capture important features from images. It converts images into histograms of gradient orientations, which are then used as input features for training the SVM model.


then The dataset was split into training and validation sets. To address class imbalance, we used the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic samples of the minority class. The features were standardized using StandardScaler before training the SVM model.


After all, We evaluated the performance of the SVM model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.And We utilized MLflow to track the training process and log important metrics, parameters, and artifacts.

</br></br></br>
At the end The best-performing SVM model was saved using joblib for potential deployment in a production environment. Considerations for model deployment, such as 
scalability and reliability, were also discussed.</br>


#### using random Forest :
RandomForest is a supervised machine learning algorithm commonly employed for tasks involving classification and regression. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. We selected RandomForest for this project due to its effectiveness in determining whether an image represents malware or benign content.
</br>
We followed the same process for data collection and training with the SVM model. At the end, the best-performing RandomForest model was saved using joblib for potential deployment in a production environment.

### Experiment tracking :
xperiment tracking is the process of recording all the important components such as hyper parameters, metrics, models and artifacts like plots PNG images, files etc. Experiment tracking helps to reproduce the old results by using the stored parameters. Under one experiment different runs can be created and by changing the parameters value we can evaluate model performance. And easily do the model performance comparison and finalize the optimal model for production. MLFlow is the widely used tool for experiment tracking across organizations.
</br>
<srtong>Importance of MLflow in Our Project:</strong>
</b>
Reproducibility: Each experiment run is logged with all relevant details, making it easier to reproduce results.
Comparison: The metrics and parameters of different runs can be compared to identify the best model.
Versioning: Model versioning allows us to keep track of improvements and maintain a history of model performance.
Deployment: The tracked models can be easily deployed using MLflow's model deployment capabilities, ensuring a seamless transition from experimentation to production.

</br></br>
The experiment is named RandomForest_Classification, clearly indicating the purpose of the experiment.
</br></br>

</br></br></br>
</br>The parameters and metrics indicate that the RandomForest model has been well-tuned and performs effectively on the classification task. The high accuracy and precision values suggest that the model makes correct predictions most of the time. The recall value shows the model's ability to identify most of the positive instances. The F1-Score, being close to the precision and recall values, indicates a good balance between them. Lastly, the ROC AUC score demonstrates strong overall performance in distinguishing between the classes.
